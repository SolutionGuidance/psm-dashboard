"""Make JSON input for the PSM dashboard, using data from various sources.

Start a virtualenv and install requirements.txt:

  $ virtualenv --python=python3.5 .
  $ source bin/activate
  $ pip install -U -r requirements.txt

  ## Edit the config file as needed.  Getting some values may be
  ## a bit of work: see https://gist.github.com/burnash/6771295 and
  ## https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/python. 
  ## Note that you will need to have a Google account, and that
  ## account must have access to the spreadsheet whose ID you're
  ## using as your "google_sheet_id."  For the GitHub API key, grant it
  ## access to the `public_repos` scope. 
  $ cp psm-dashboard-config.json.tmpl psm-dashboard-config.json
  $ your-favorite-editor psm-dashboard-config.json

  ## This puts psm_reqs.py in your Python import path by putting it in
  ## the current directory.
  $ ln -s somewhere/psm/requirements/psm_reqs.py ./psm_reqs.py

Usage:

  $ ./gather-info > features-info.json

Default output is JSON data as described in the dashboard README.md.
(Note that some "PROGESS:" prints will appear on stderr; they are being
used as a cheap kind of progress meter.  Just redirect stdout as in
the above example to separate JSON output from the noise on stderr.)

Alternate usage:

  $ ./gather-info --featureless-reqs

With the '--featureless-reqs' option, show instead a list of exactly
those requirements (from the RTM) that are not associated with any
high-level feature.

To see this usage message, run with '-h' or '--help'.
