# You could view the reqs by running this any time:
#
#   $ ./reqs2any --output=human RTM.csv
#
# If you need to load them into Emacs (with `psm-load-reqs' 
# from psm-reqs.el), then do something like this:
#
#   $ ./reqs2any --output=elisp RTM.csv > RTM.el
#
# Then you can invoke `psm-load-reqs' on RTM.el.
